# Guess-the-Number-Game

## Introduction

In this project, I have created a simple guess-the-number game. The game was created by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface for this game was designed by Jonas Schmedtmann as part of his Udemy JavaScript course.

The gameplay consists of the player trying to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. The player starts with a total of 20 points. After each wrong guess, a point is deduced from the current score. Additionally, the player is notified if the provided number is higher or lower than the randomly generated number.

The game stops when the player guesses the correct number, or when the player's points reach zero. If the correct number is guessed, the remaining points represent the score.

The game can be repeated by pressing the "Again" button. If the score of the next game is higher than the score of the previous round it is saved in the high score paragraph.
